#Lab Tasks

- Questions that you need to answer (as a group!) are formatted as large, bold headers. 
- Tasks that specify work to do without a written response will be bulleted. 

Responses to questions should be submitted as specified by your instructor. 

If you're ever confused about what you need to do for a given task, ask.

## Part #1: Exploring the project
Study the project you have cloned. Run it according to the instrucitons in the README, including running the tests. Answer the following questions.

> Protip: Using Google to gain additional knowledge or support your conjectures about how something works is great! It's important that you think about everything and come to an understanding, though, so don't use Google as a scapegoat to get the questions done quickly or you will regret it!

##### What is the purpose of Server.java? Explain what happens when a user is trying to access a page "kittens", when a user is trying to access the page "petForm", and when the user submits a form on "petForm". Explain what a "route" is.


##### What is the contents of the "public" folder? What is each of the HTML files there and how are they referenced in Server.java?


##### In your project, change the message that appears when the user is trying to access the page "kittens". Describe what you did and how it worked.

##### Next, change the message that a user sees when they are trying to find a page that doesn't exist.

##### Describe what happens when you submit a form on "petForm" page. What are the form parameters in petForm? What is the method for the form? Where is the form submission handled in the project? How are parameters extracted? How is the resulting message generated? How is this different from accessing the page petForm the first time (to see the form)?

##### Where is client-side JavaScript defined? Name file(s) in which it is used.

##### What is the purpose of build.gradle file? What's in it, and what does it mean?

##### What's in .gitgnore file? What's the purpose of it?

## Part #2: Exploring testing

##### Find the client-side testing file, describe where it is located and what it is testing. Run karma (the client-side testing engine) as specified in the README and describe results. Do not edit any files at this time.

##### Find the server-side testing file, describe where it is located and what it is testing. Run JUnit as specified in the README and describe results. Do not edit any files at this time.

##### After having set up Travis CI with your forked project, play around with the page for your project (build history, settings, branches, etc) and describe at least 3 features you think would be useful when troubleshooting a broken project or failing build.

##### What was the build status of your project right after you got everything set up? Use Travis to find any problems, and describe what failed, if anything. (Which files, what lines, why did failure occur, etc.)

##### Fix any problems described in the previous question. Describe how you fixed them. Push your fix to GitHub and post a link to the passing build (from the build history) here.

- Study jasmine testing syntax. Think of a JavaScript function, describe its behavior by writing tests for it (this is test-driven development, or TDD). Add the function, run the tests. (Actually do this. Don't forget to commit and push your changes!)

## Part #3: Adding something other than a GPA calculator!

> TODO: Write vague instructions for this!
